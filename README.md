# Private Messages bot

[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/AndreoliBR/privatemessages/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/AndreoliBR/privatemessages)

Private Messages is a bot built using [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) and NodeJS. Its purpose is to create and manage paid messages, using its own currency. To access messages and their resources, the user must start the bot using the `/start` command.

## Deprecation

This is an old, funny project I made to play with my friends. While this bot may work, I'll not work on it anymore. If you want to, feel free to fork and maintain this project - maybe adding new features and switching to [grammY](https://github.com/grammyjs/grammY).

If you have further questions, feel free to contact me by opening an issue or at my social media (listed on my profile readme).

## Instalation

You can use the following commands to run this bot on a local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreoliBR/privatemessages.git folder-name
cd folder-name
yarn
```
